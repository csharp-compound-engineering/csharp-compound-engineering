# Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the CSharp Compound Docs MCP server architecture, including system design, component interactions, and key design decisions.

## High-Level Overview

CSharp Compound Docs is a Claude Code plugin that implements the "compound-engineering" paradigm for C#/.NET projects. It enables developers to capture and retrieve institutional knowledge through:

- **GraphRAG pipeline** combining graph traversal with vector search
- **AWS OpenSearch Serverless** for vector storage and semantic search
- **Amazon Neptune** for knowledge graph storage (documents, concepts, relationships)
- **Amazon Bedrock** for embeddings (Titan) and LLM synthesis (Claude)
- **Git-based synchronization** via LibGit2Sharp for repository monitoring

### Key Principles

1. **GraphRAG Over Simple RAG** - Knowledge graph enrichment produces higher-quality answers than flat vector search
2. **Cloud-Native AWS** - Fully managed AWS services (Neptune, OpenSearch Serverless, Bedrock) eliminate infrastructure management
3. **Concept-Driven Knowledge** - Documents are decomposed into concepts and relationships, enabling multi-hop reasoning
4. **Cross-Repository Links** - Concepts can be resolved across multiple repositories

## Technology Stack

### Core Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| MCP Server | .NET 9 Generic Host | Application hosting, DI, logging |
| MCP Protocol | ModelContextProtocol.Server | Claude Code integration (stdio) |
| Vector Storage | AWS OpenSearch Serverless | Semantic search via KNN |
| Knowledge Graph | Amazon Neptune (openCypher) | Concept relationships, multi-hop traversal |
| Embeddings | Amazon Bedrock (Titan Embed v2) | 1024-dimension vector generation |
| LLM Synthesis | Amazon Bedrock (Claude) | RAG answer generation, entity extraction |
| Git Sync | LibGit2Sharp | Repository cloning, change detection |
| Orchestration | .NET Aspire | Service discovery, observability |

### Supporting Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Markdig | Markdown parsing, YAML frontmatter |
| NJsonSchema | Schema validation |
| YamlDotNet | YAML configuration parsing |
| Polly | Resilience (retry, circuit breaker) for all AWS calls |
| Serilog | Structured logging (stderr for MCP compliance) |
| Gremlin.Net | Neptune graph client connectivity |

### AWS Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| OpenSearch Serverless | Vector index with KNN search |
| Neptune | Graph database for knowledge graph |
| Bedrock | Embeddings (Titan) + LLM (Claude Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) |

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: GraphRAG Over Simple Vector RAG

**Choice**: Combine knowledge graph traversal with vector search for retrieval

**Rationale**:
- Multi-hop reasoning discovers related concepts that flat search misses
- Document relationships (LINKS_TO, RELATES_TO) provide structural context
- Concept nodes enable cross-document and cross-repository knowledge connections

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher complexity than simple vector-only RAG
- Requires maintaining both a graph database and a vector store

### Decision 2: AWS Cloud-Native Services

**Choice**: Use fully managed AWS services (Neptune, OpenSearch Serverless, Bedrock)

**Rationale**:
- Zero infrastructure management for databases and AI models
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Consistent AWS IAM for authentication and authorization
- No local GPU or model management required

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires AWS account and credentials
- Running costs scale with usage
- Network latency compared to local services

### Decision 3: Tiered LLM Model Selection

**Choice**: Use different Claude model tiers (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) for different tasks

**Rationale**:
- Entity extraction uses Haiku (cheapest) since it's a simpler task
- RAG synthesis uses Sonnet (balanced cost/quality)
- Complex reasoning tasks can escalate to Opus

**Trade-offs**:
- Configuration complexity for model IDs
- Different latency characteristics per tier

### Decision 4: Git-Based Change Detection

**Choice**: Use LibGit2Sharp to clone repositories and detect changes via git diff

**Rationale**:
- Git is the natural source of truth for code repositories
- Diff-based detection is efficient (only process changed files)
- Supports monitoring multiple repositories with configurable polling
- Branch awareness built in

**Trade-offs**:
- Polling-based (configurable interval, default 5 minutes)
- Requires git credentials for private repositories

### Decision 5: Stdio Transport

**Choice**: MCP server uses stdio transport (not HTTP)

**Rationale**:
- One server instance per Claude Code session
- Simpler security model (no network exposure)
- Automatic lifecycle management by Claude Code

**Trade-offs**:
- Cannot share server across multiple clients
- Server restarts on each Claude Code session

## Security Architecture

### Network Security

```
+-------------------+
|   Claude Code     |
|   (trusted)       |
+--------+----------+
         |
         | stdio (local only)
         v
+-------------------+
|    MCP Server     |
|   (localhost)     |
+--------+----------+
         |
         | HTTPS + AWS IAM SigV4
         v
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
| OpenSearch        |     |    Neptune        |     |    Bedrock        |
| Serverless        |     |                   |     |                   |
| (AWS managed)     |     | (AWS managed)     |     | (AWS managed)     |
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
```

### Security Boundaries

| Boundary | Protection |
|----------|------------|
| MCP Transport | stdio (no network exposure) |
| AWS Services | IAM authentication, SigV4 request signing |
| Neptune | VPC-based access control |
| OpenSearch Serverless | AWS IAM policies, encryption at rest |
| Bedrock | Model access policies, no data retention |

### Data Security

| Data Type | Protection |
|-----------|------------|
| Documents | Git repository access controls |
| Embeddings | OpenSearch Serverless encryption at rest |
| Graph Data | Neptune encryption at rest and in transit |
| AWS Credentials | IAM roles, environment variables, AWS credential chain |
| API Keys | AuthConfig with key-based access |

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture

| Metric | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Vector search | OpenSearch Serverless auto-scales |
| Graph queries | Neptune scales with instance size |
| Embeddings | Bedrock is serverless, scales on demand |
| Repositories | Configurable list with independent polling |
| Concurrent sessions | 1 per MCP server instance (stdio limitation) |

### Cross-Repository Support

The system supports monitoring multiple repositories:

```json
{
  "Repositories": [
    { "Url": "https://github.com/org/repo-a.git", "Name": "repo-a", "Branch": "main" },
    { "Url": "https://github.com/org/repo-b.git", "Name": "repo-b", "Branch": "main" }
  ]
}
```

Concepts discovered in one repository can be linked to concepts in another via the `ICrossRepoEntityResolver`.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging

| Component | Destination | Format |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| MCP Server | stderr | Structured JSON (Serilog) |
| Worker Service | stderr | Structured JSON (Serilog) |
| AWS Services | CloudWatch | AWS native logging |

### OpenTelemetry

The Aspire ServiceDefaults project provides:
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics collection
- HTTP client instrumentation
- Service discovery

### Resilience

All AWS service calls use Polly resilience policies:
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker for sustained failures
- Timeout policies
