# CSharp Compound Docs

A GraphRAG-powered knowledge oracle for C#/.NET projects, built as a Claude Code plugin (`cd`).

## What is CSharp Compound Docs?

CSharp Compound Docs implements the "compound-engineering" paradigm — combining **knowledge graph traversal** with **vector search** to provide high-quality, context-aware answers from your codebase documentation.

### Key Features

- **GraphRAG pipeline** — combines graph traversal with vector search for superior retrieval
- **AWS cloud-native** — fully managed services (Neptune, OpenSearch Serverless, Bedrock)
- **Git-based sync** — automatic repository monitoring and change detection via LibGit2Sharp
- **Multi-hop reasoning** — discover related concepts across documents and repositories
- **MCP integration** — works directly with Claude Code via the `rag_query` tool

## Quick Start

1. **[Install prerequisites](/installation)** — .NET 9 SDK, AWS account, and AWS CLI
2. **[First-time setup](/first-time-setup)** — configure AWS endpoints and repository monitoring
3. **[Configure settings](/configuration)** — tune GraphRAG parameters for your use case

## Architecture Overview

```
Claude Code → Plugin (cd) → MCP Server (HTTP) → GraphRAG Pipeline
                              ├── OpenSearch Serverless (vector search)
                              ├── Amazon Neptune (knowledge graph)
                              └── Amazon Bedrock (embeddings + LLM)
```

See the [Architecture](/architecture) page for the full system design.
