## spec/research-index.md

### What This File Covers

This document serves as a comprehensive index for all pre-research documents in the `/research/` folder. It catalogs 54 research documents organized into 9 categories:

1. **Claude Code Integration** (11 docs) - Plugin architecture, skills, agents, hooks, and marketplace ecosystem
2. **Semantic Kernel & RAG** (10 docs) - Microsoft Semantic Kernel, embeddings, RAG patterns, and AI service integration
3. **.NET Development** (11 docs) - Generic Host, dependency injection, configuration, background services
4. **Infrastructure & Database** (7 docs) - Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Ollama, Liquibase
5. **Testing & Quality** (6 docs) - xUnit, Moq, Shouldly, code coverage, Aspire testing
6. **CI/CD & Marketplace** (4 docs) - GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, plugin marketplace hosting
7. **Configuration & Schema** (3 docs) - JSON Schema validation, YAML frontmatter processing
8. **Git & Version Control** (1 doc) - Git branch detection
9. **Verification & Corrections** (1 doc) - Package name verifications

Each research document is described with its filename and a brief description of its contents. The index also provides guidance on how to use research documents during implementation.

### Structural Relationships

- **Parent**: [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) - The main specification document
- **Children**: All 54 research documents in the `/research/` folder (linked in tables)
- **Siblings**: Other spec files at the same level (likely other index or specification documents under `/spec/`)

This file acts as a navigation hub connecting the main specification to detailed research findings that inform design decisions.
